# TIC TAC TOE GAME IMPLEMENTED IN TERMINAL
#### Video Demo:
#### Description:
This is the tic tac toe game implemented using python. The game is implemented in terminal which is the limitation of it as the game is not implemented using graphics. Tic tac toe is a simple game where two parties play one with cross and one with circle and fill the 3X3 boxes with the respective signs. One who is able to <b> fill three boxes either diagonally or paralley </b> is declared winner. It is short and sweet game.

I did the implementation with four functions `main` , `display board`,  `gameover` and `winner `. `main` function uses other three function and globally declared list to do the implementation of the game logic. Although the game is not implemented in graphics, the board will be displayed at each step or input from users to represent the current state and make game more interactive.
